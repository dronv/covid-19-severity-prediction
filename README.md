# COVID-19 Severity Prediction using Machine Learning Model
It is now evident that the world needs a speedy and quicker solution to contain and tackle the further spread of COVID-19 across the world with the aid of non-clinical approaches.

# Machine Learning Backend
## Model Selection
•  Random Forest approach, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Logistic Regressor, 
    Decision Tree Regressor, and Classifier were used to and compared. <br>
• However, the other models also performed well, with Logistic Regression achieving 92.26% accuracy, k-NN achieving 92.86% accuracy, 
and Random Forest Classifier achieving 93.45% accuracy. <br>

## Model
• Conditions of Covid-19: Regular, Semi-Intensive, Intensive. <br>
• Prepared a ML Model to distinguish types of treatment they should receive. <br>
• Model trained with clinical laboratory data. <br>
• Take input up to 10 types of information and provides results with 93.45% accuracy. <br>

## Feature Selection
• Used th efeature selection method by random forest and selected the 10 most important features.
